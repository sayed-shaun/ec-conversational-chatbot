"""
Last-resort scrub of the assistant's own plumbing out of a reply.

The prompt already tells the model not to mention the tool, but a 2-bit
quantised model does not reliably obey that -- it has been observed replying
"আমি `search_ec_services` টুল ব্যবহার করতে পারি" instead of answering. A rule
in the prompt is a request; this module is the guarantee, so the tool name can
never reach a citizen reading the chat.

Removal is per sentence, not per word: dropping just the identifier out of
"আমি X টুল ব্যবহার করতে পারি" leaves a sentence that still narrates the
lookup, which is the actual problem. Bengali sentences end in a daṛi (।), so
that counts as a terminator alongside the ASCII ones.
